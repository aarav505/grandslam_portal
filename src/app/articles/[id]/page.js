    content: "10th October 2023. The date remains vivid as ever in my mind; 4 PM kickoff, overcast conditions, and a kind of ethereal exuberance at a potential future that lay ahead of us. The stage was set: a Juniors 1 match against Hyderabad, our biggest rivals in our pursuit of greatness. A win was needed, nothing else would be enough. Blue enveloped the pitch, cheering the most vicious and intimidating chants; however, pockets of green opened up on the sidelines, offering support and hope. The scenario was clear: it was the full school against us, the Eagles, for we were on the verge of unprecedented success. The first half was a blur, we struggled to grasp the situation we were in, and the job that was left to do ahead of us. Before we knew it, two goals had snuck past us. 2-0. We played a second half of desperation, of regret, of penance; we could not do better than 2-0. 2023 was not to be. 2024 built up in similar fashion. We were reinvigorated, determined to not let our momentum, our vision die out. Nobody expected us to win Cricket, especially as dominatingly as we did. Hockey was even more out of reach; our domination disproved that theory, as we swept aside every other house. Going into football season,we felt invincible. If a brush of bad luck had cost us greatness the year before, our stronghold over football would prove too strong for anyone else to break apart. We never built up the momentum that season; washouts and inconsistent performances proved to sound the death knell on our second grand slam year. At that point, few people (yours truly included) well and truly believed that we ‘could be third time lucky.’ We were likened to Arsenal for our so-called ‘bottling’ ( A statement which I, as a Chelsea fan, took to heart) and inability to win in matches where it well and truly mattered. This time, Cricket was a rout; we dominated our competitions in Mediums and Seniors. There was a different energy around the house; we were desperate not to let it all slip. The dives would be a bit more efforted along the boundary ropes, the runs would be taken a bit faster, balls were delivered with a sense of urgency; as if victory could not come soon enough. Even when murmurs were raised of a potential trinity being achieved by us, we were quick to dispel them. ‘Look at House A in Hockey, we stand no chance against them.’ ‘Look at N in Football, the Shield is too far out of reach this year.’ On the field, we never played with that mentality, because somewhere deep down inside, even though we never outrightly said it, we knew that we had the capability to take it all the way. A poor start to the Hockey season was brought to a halt by unforeseen circumstances, as we were all sent home. We had no idea whether we would even play Hockey again that year, so we devoted our full-fledged focus to the Shield. Something that had become a relic of the Jaipur House trophy cabinet, a pride of every boy clad in Green, had to be reclaimed; we had to win football. Emerging triumphant in the Juniors category and remaining competitive in both the Mediums and Seniors categories led us to finally win back the sport we cherished the most. We received confirmation; Hockey would happen, we would have another chance at redemption. Yet again, we were written off before the season could even start. A poor start where we could only muster up 42 out of the first 100 points on over essentially ruled us out of everyone's minds, including our own, to be honest. However, no matter how glum our calculations were, we saw a glimmer of hope. Claim as many points as possible, and maybe just maybe, ………………. . We did what we could: win our remaining matches. Thankfully, this set us up for another final-day set of deciders. Our day started earlier than most, with an afternoon H1 encounter against Hyderabad. 4-0 seemed more of a statement than a result, that we were waiting to be put in such a scenario, because this time, we were willing to fight for our dream. A stalemate in L1 and win in L2 led us to a defining match against Tata. A match which would define whether the efforts of our past three years had been in vain or were about to reach a crescendo. Whether the final whistle would be dreaded like those before, or celebrated like those envisioned for our future. The rest, as they say, is history. In a perfect world, we would have won all three years. We would not have felt the same heartbreak we did in ‘23 and ‘24. However, this version of the story feels more authentic; we lost, we learnt, we won. We felt every emotion there was to feel, and formed bonds on the pitch which could not have been made anywhere else. Perhaps most importantly, even THIS version had a happy ending. "

    excerpt: "Loechin Phangcho",
    image: "/articles/cycling.jpg",
    content: " When we think of sports in India, the first ones that come to mind are cricket, football, badminton, and maybe hockey. But there is one name that rarely ever leaves the tongue in a conversation about competitive sports, despite it being one of the most demanding disciplines: Cycling. For most of you reading, the image of a cycle is tied to those evening rides up and down gullies with your friends during your childhood, a means of transport, or leisure weekend rides. Rarely do we ever view it as the sport that requires hours and hours of training on end, systematic training schedules, often leading to more pain than gain, just like any other endurance sport– yet this sublime art will forever hold a special place in my heart. Around the rest of the world, cycling is taken to its limits. The Tour de France, Giro d’Italia, Strade Bianche, and Paris-Roubaix– to name a couple– attract millions of views from fans around the globe. And these… are just the events on the road calendar. The level of bike racing that can be seen is nothing short of phenomenal. Top teams and competitors can be seen strategizing and playing every hand they can to shave seconds off a time trial, timing the sprint down to the meter, or pacing hellish mountain stages. These cyclists are at the peak of human performance, blurring the line between man and machine. However, when it comes to our nation, cycling struggles for recognition as a sport. There are a few reasons for this, namely, infrastructure and social attitudes. The nature of the sport requires long sections of smooth roads with no interruptions – infrastructure that is rarely found in this country. The first of such that might come to mind are highways, which are terrible alternatives due to the risk factor involved with the Indian driver having almost zero civic sense. Nevertheless, the conditions of roads in many places can be seen improving at a decent rate, making it the perfect time to introduce the idea of cycling as a sport to sportspeople in this country The second factor limiting the reach of cycling is the social attitudes that plague people's minds. I don't think that people would deny cycling its status as a sport if they knew a fraction of what it entails. Cycling races get almost no coverage on Indian news and media. Almost every cyclist that you will see on the streets is either a commuter or a leisure recreational rider.  Even if the roads and attitudes improve, another wall remains– the sheer cost of participation. The final aspect that results in low recognition of cycling as a sport: the astronomically high barrier to entry. The fact remains that cycling can be a very expensive sport to pursue. When you consider the fact that just to start racing, you will require a good road bike, helmet, shoes and clipless pedals, race kit (jerseys, bib shorts, eyewear, gloves, socks), accessories (bike computer, power meter, bottles), tools and maintenance gear, travel and racing costs, the barrier to entry usually shoots up right there around the ₹5,50,000 mark. And that's just for a decent setup. Compare this to the average yearly income of an earning individual in India, which sits somewhere between ₹2,50,000-₹8,00,000, and you soon start to realise why this sport might not have picked up yet. I just know that sometimes my parents wish that I had never picked up a bike when the time for very necessary upgrades comes This is why, a lot of times when people ask me what my sport is, and I reply with “cycling,” I get that puzzled look. Almost without fail, the follow-up question comes: “Yeah, but what sport-sport do you play?” It quickly becomes frustrating. But then again, when you see the look on their faces when you tell them what kind of hours and distances you have to cover during training makes up for it. Anyone who has trained seriously on a bike knows it’s far more demanding than a pastime. I learned this firsthand when I began cycling more consistently and putting out grueling hours on that saddle over the course of my cycling journey. Once you get hooked on the numbers– average speed, top speed, power output, lap timings– you can never stop. That’s something that ends up consuming you, the never-ending quest for impossible perfection.  Hence, I always make it a point to enjoy the beauty of being one with your bike, even during hellish sessions. I’d argue that very few sports compare to the feeling of your body seemingly merging with the bike; it becomes a part of you. The snap and jolt right at the start of a sprint (as well as the overwhelming need to regurgitate after). The feeling of absolutely soaring down descents, taking calculated (most of the time) risks at every corner. When the wind hits your face and carries your sweat away, you face down and just hear the whoosh of your wheels and the tread of your tires against the tarmac, not to forget the sound of drivetrain efficiency. It's a feeling to behold, something that I will never be able to give up. In India, the culture around cycling is slowly changing. More road races, criteriums, and endurance events are being organized. Cycling clubs are popping up in cities, and social media is helping spread awareness. But it still needs a push — a change in perspective.  So, the next time someone asks me what sport I play, I hope that I won’t have to prepare an explanation for doing what I love to do. Cycling is a sport in every sense of the word. It requires the same dedication, passion, and effort as almost every other sport. And in a country like ours, where young talents are in constant need of opportunities to shine, let us give them one. It has the potential to become much bigger than it currently is. Maybe cycling in India doesn’t yet have the limelight it deserves, but that doesn’t mean it’s not worth the chase. For those of us who haven’t yet felt the thrill of a sprint finish, the discipline of early-morning rides, or the satisfaction of hitting a new personal best, I want us to know that it's not “just cycling.” It's a sport. Its lifestyle. It goes beyond two wheels and a carbon skeleton. For me, cycling embodies the perfect metaphor for life. Just one pedal stroke gets you nowhere. It's how you can keep pedaling after every easy descent and through every tough climb that gets you past the finish line."

    title: "FIFA WORLD CUP - 2026",
    date: "Dec 01, 2025",
    excerpt: "Ranveer Tomar",
    image: "/articles/world.jpg",
    content: "In 2026, the FIFA World Cup returns bigger, bolder, and more global than ever before — uniting North America and the world in a football festival that promises records, rivalries, and unforgettable moments. Now, 48 nations are participating for global dominance instead of the usual 32, which we have been seeing for so many years now.  Although the idea of having 48 teams play in the World Cup was approved by FIFA in 2017, we get to see it for the first time in 2026. To host 48 nations, FIFA initially planned to have 16 groups of 3 teams each, but now they are leaning towards the idea of having 12 groups consisting of 4 countries in each one, to prevent collusion. This has a lot of benefits, as it allows for broader global representation and exposure for teams who have never taken part in the tournament before. There are a few concerns regarding this idea as well, as we could get to see a potential drop in match quality due to more low-ranked teams. There is also a risk of player burnout and fatigue, as the new format calls for 104 games instead of the usual 64. Although this idea is quite ambitious and supported by many, it’s also a bold move towards globalization.  In this edition, we will see all the matches taking place in North America, with three hosting the tournament. Majority of the games will be played in the United States, which will span across 11 cities hosting matches. Mexico makes a historic return, as we see Estadio Azteca becoming the first stadium to host three World Cup Editions (1970, 1986, and 2026). Canada is a newcomer in hosting the competition, using stadiums such as BMO Field and BC Place. Of course, there are travel challenges involved for faraway countries, such as time zones, climate differences and cross-border movement, which could also affect player performance. Quoting the former USMNT manager Jürgen Klinsmann, “Hosting the World Cup across three countries sends a powerful message. It’s not just about football — it’s about unity, culture, and creating something truly unforgettable for fans around the world.” As the world sets its sights on 2026, a new generation of football stars is already rising — and the battle lines between giants and underdogs are being drawn. The favourites to win this edition include France, with a deep squad and generational talents, such as rising stars Desire Doue, and Kylian Mbappe, who will be looking to add to his World Cup tally, and captain his nation whilst doing so. Argentina also has a high chance that, with this World Cup supposedly being Messi’s last, he wouldn’t want to leave empty-handed. England are also top contenders, with pressure upon them from past performances in the Euro 2024 final; can they make a turnaround without Southgate? Brazil, the most talented nation will also look to win the tournament after previous performances and disappointments. Dark horses this time include Morocco, who made the semi-finals last time, Japan and South Korea, technically sharp and tactically advanced, USA with a young playerbase and home ground advantage, and finally Canada with Alphonso Davies and Jonathan David.  The magic of 2026 won’t just be on the pitch — from high-tech innovations to cultural fusion and sustainability efforts, this World Cup aims to be as groundbreaking off the field as it is on it; with VAR improvements, semiautomated offside and an unmatched fan experience with big cities like Los Angeles, Toronto and Mexico City, helping blend football with culture. Although all of this may sound very promising, concerns are being raised about affordability, accessibility, and travel logistics; they all could be issues for some teams. More than just a football tournament, the 2026 World Cup will celebrate unity, ambition, and the beautiful game’s boundless reach, all while redefining the scale and spirit of football on the world stage. In 2026, football won’t just be played — it will be celebrated across a continent, by a world ready for something extraordinary. "
